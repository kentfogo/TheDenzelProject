              <h3> The world was not ready...</h3>
              <p>Born in 1954 to a preacher who held down three jobs and a no nonsense mother,
              Denzel was understandably a bit lost when he left home as an adult.
              After a woeful semester at Fordham University, <strong> a 1.8 gpa! </strong>, and
              deciding not to join the army, he decided to take acting seriously.
              In a few months’ time, he rented a roach-infested apartment and the world was about to be introduced to a force of nature…</p>

              <h3> The ascent begins...</h3>
              <p>While Denzel's first lead role was as Roger Porter in Carbon Copy, he really made
                and impression on the hospital drama, St. Elsewhere.  Audiences couldn't get enough of him
                on the six-season run, he was simply electifiying.</p>

            <h3>Superstar!</h3>
            <p>Two years after leaving St. Elsewhere, Denzel was a bonafider superstar.
              As the lead in movies such as Malcolm X, Mo' Better Blues, Glory and Philadelphia,
            he was minted as on of the best actors ever.</p>

              <h3>Passing it forward</h3>
              <p>Now in his 60's, Denzel is part of the old guard of Hollywood. He has
              inspired many actors with his incredible performance and has funded scholarships for
              black actors including the late, great Chadwick Boseman.  As an "acting" paternal figure,
              Denzel has fathered many sons such as Will Smith, Jamie Fox and so on...</p>

            <h2>Who is Better? Denzel Washington vs. Will Smith</h2>
            <div class = "Denzel">

            <p>Many detractors of Denzel and his acting prowess like to
            bring up Will Smith as a comparison.  As if he is worthy of this
            matchup. Points for Denzel are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>One of the best dramatic actors of his time</li>
              <li>Better Historical/Historical Fiction Movies such as:
                Malcolm X, Remember the Titans, Glory,</li>
              <li>Awards: Denzel has won Oscars and Golden Globes. Will Smith has not.</li>
              <li>The bad guy: Denzel simply isn't afraid to play the bad guy.
              The anti-hero. The corrupt cop. The drug lord.
              Will Smith is always the guy saving the day.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class = "Will">
              <p>What does Will have over Denzel?</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Will Smith has more comedic roles than Denzel. He's one of the best
                at making you life and just bringing a...pleasant tone to the screen.</li>
                <li>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: A culture defining series. Better than anyhting
                Denzel has done on television.</li>
                <li>Animated Movies: Will Smith flourished in animated movies. See A Shark's Tale.</li>
              </ul>
